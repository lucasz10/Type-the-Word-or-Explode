# Type-the-Word-or-Explode

## Your Task

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a game that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use 2 different API's in the functionality of the game. Use different CSS Framework other than Bootstrap. Read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions. You will use 'localStorage' to store any persistent data.
